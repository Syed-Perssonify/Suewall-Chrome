              </h2>
              <p>
                Our Extension provides a convenient tool for investors and legal
                professionals to track active securities litigation cases
                related to publicly traded companies. Key features include:
                automatic detection of ticker symbols on supported financial
                websites, real-time checking against L&K's database of active
                cases, instant notifications about new lawsuits or important
                case updates, and tools to manage claims or express interest in
                participating in class actions. The Extension integrates with
                various finance platforms (e.g., Yahoo Finance, Nasdaq,
                MarketWatch, etc.) to streamline the flow of information. Note:
                The specific features and supported websites may evolve over
                time as we improve our services.

                The Extension is provided free of charge to users. However,
                certain related services (such as legal representation in a
                class action) may have their own terms or require entering into
                additional agreements (for example, a retainer or
                attorney-client agreement, if you choose L&K to represent you in
                a case).

                The Extension may occasionally display or provide content that

              </h3>
              <p>
                The Extension and any information or notifications it provides
                (such as alerts about lawsuits or settlements) are for
                informational purposes only. The Extension is designed to alert
                you to the existence of legal actions involving securities you
                may be interested in. However, nothing in the Extension
                constitutes legal advice or financial advice. We do not
                guarantee that the information is comprehensive or up-to-date,
                and it should not be the sole basis for making legal decisions
                or investment decisions. Always consider consulting a qualified
                attorney or financial advisor before taking action based on
                information from the Extension.

              </h3>
              <p>
                Using this Extension does not create an attorney-client
                relationship between you and Levi & Korsinsky, LLP.
                Communication through the Extension (such as receiving an alert
                or even requesting to join a class action) is not by itself an
                agreement for legal representation. An attorney-client
                relationship with L&K can only be established through direct
                communication with our attorneys and the signing of a retainer
                or similar agreement. Until such an agreement is executed, you
                are not a client of L&K, and information you provide may not be
                protected by attorney-client privilege. That said, we will treat
                any personal information you provide with care as described in
                our Privacy Policy.

              <p>
                The Extension, and the notifications or prompts it provides
                (such as inviting you to join a lawsuit or learn more about a
                case), may be considered attorney advertising in some
                jurisdictions. As such, please note: Prior results do not
                guarantee a similar outcome. Any testimonials or endorsements in
                the Extension do not constitute a guarantee, warranty, or
                prediction regarding the outcome of your legal matter. We
                include this notice to comply with ethical rules.

                4. No Confidential or Privileged Information via Extension
              </h3>
              <p>
                Do not use the Extension to submit any confidential information
                about a legal matter unless specifically requested by an
                authorized L&K attorney. The initial information collected via
                the Extension (e.g., expressing interest in a case by clicking
                "Join") may not be treated as privileged or confidential until
                an attorney-client relationship is formally established. For
                example, if you enter details about your stock trades to see if
                you qualify for a class action, that act alone does not make you
                a client; however, once you formally engage us, relevant
                information you provide will be kept confidential in accordance
                with our professional obligations.

                materials included therein. To the fullest extent permitted by
                applicable law, we disclaim all warranties, express or implied,
                including but not limited to implied warranties of
                merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and
                non-infringement. We do not warrant that the Extension will be

                In particular, while we strive for accuracy, we do not guarantee
                the completeness, accuracy, or timeliness of any information
                provided by the Extension. For example, there may be delays in
                updating our case database, or we may not yet have information
                on a newly filed case. Users should independently verify
                important information. The Extension's automated detections and
                notifications are also dependent on third-party websites and
                data; we cannot guarantee that this functionality will always
                work or capture every relevant instance. You assume full
                responsibility and risk for your use of the Extension.

                <strong>No Warranty on Outcomes:</strong> L&K does not promise
                any specific results from your use of the Extension. For
                instance, if the Extension alerts you to a class action, we do
                not guarantee you will be eligible to recover money –
                eligibility and recovery depend on legal criteria and the
                outcome of the case. The Extension is a tool to assist you, but
                it cannot foresee every scenario or ensure any particular legal
                or financial outcome.

                Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain

                To the maximum extent permitted by law, L&K and its partners,
                affiliates, and suppliers will not be liable for any indirect,
                incidental, special, consequential, or exemplary damages arising
                out of or in connection with your use of (or inability to use)
                the Extension and its services. This includes, without
                limitation, damages for lost profits, lost opportunities, lost

                we have been advised of the possibility of such damages.

                L&K's total cumulative liability to you for any direct damages

                claim. (Currently, the Extension is free, and you pay us nothing
                to use it, so in most cases this liability cap will be $100 or
                the minimum amount allowable by law.) This limitation applies
                whether the claims are based on warranty, contract, tort
                (including negligence), strict liability, or any other legal
                theory.

                Federal Arbitration Act; disputes will not be resolved by a
                judge or jury or in a class action.)

                <strong>Exceptions:</strong> Either party may bring a qualifying
                claim in small claims court. Also, either party may seek
                injunctive relief in a court of proper jurisdiction in cases of
                misuse of intellectual property or unauthorized access (for
                example, you hacking our service, or us needing to stop you from
                using our trademarks improperly) without first engaging in
                arbitration.
              </p>
              <p className="mt-3">
                <strong>Arbitration Procedures:</strong> The arbitration will be
                administered by a reputable arbitration organization (such as
                the American Arbitration Association) under its rules. The
                arbitration will take place in New York, NY, unless you and L&K
                agree otherwise. We will pay the arbitration fees for claims up
                to a certain amount, as long as the arbitrator finds the claims
                were not frivolous. Each party will bear their own attorneys'
                fees unless the arbitrator awards otherwise.

                <strong>Opt-Out:</strong> If you do not wish to agree to this
                arbitration provision, you must notify us in writing within 30
                days of first accepting these Terms, either by email or postal
                mail, stating your name and intent to opt out of the arbitration
                provision. If you opt out, only the "Governing Law" and
                jurisdiction clause above will apply to any disputes.

                You agree that any cause of action or claim you may have arising

                1. Entire Agreement
              </h3>
              <p>
                These Terms, together with the Privacy Policy and any additional
                agreements you may enter into with L&K in connection with the
                Extension, constitute the entire agreement between you and us
                regarding the Extension. They supersede all prior or
                contemporaneous understandings regarding this subject matter.
                Any additional terms that may apply (such as terms associated
                with specific promotions or features) will be considered
                incorporated into and part of these Terms.

                2. Severability
              </h3>
              <p>
                If any provision of these Terms is found to be unlawful, void,
                or unenforceable, that provision will be deemed severable from
                these Terms and will not affect the validity and enforceability
                of any remaining provisions. The unenforceable provision will be
                interpreted as closely as possible to its original intent, or
                enforced to the maximum extent permissible under law, to uphold
                the intent of these Terms.

              </h3>
              <p>
                Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms
                will not be considered a waiver of those rights. Any waiver of
                any provision of these Terms will be effective only if in
                writing and signed by an authorized representative of L&K.
